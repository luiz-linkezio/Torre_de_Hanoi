## üíª Project
Project of the course ***Computer Organization and Operating Systems***, from the graduation in [Information Systems (SI)](https://portal.cin.ufpe.br/graduacao/sistemas-de-informacao/) at the [Centro de Inform√°tica (CIn)](https://portal.cin.ufpe.br/) of the [Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE)](https://www.ufpe.br/), attended in the academic year 2023.2.
<br>

The project consists of making a Tower of Hanoi using recursion in Assembly. The Tower of Hanoi consists of three poles (vertical pins) and a number of disks of different sizes, stacked in descending order of size on a pole, the goal is to move the stack of disks from one pole to another following some rules.

<br>

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run?
To run the project easily and online, follow the instructions below:

```bash
# 1) Access the website
$ https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_assembly_online.php

# 2) Copy the code ./src/script/assembly_x86/torre_hanoit.asm and paste it into the website's text editor

# 3) Execute the project by clicking on the "Execute" button on the website

## üîñ Rules and Guidelines
Build a program in Assembly X86 on Windows that solves the classic puzzle known as Tower of Hanoi. The Tower of Hanoi is a game that involves three towers A, B, and C, containing N disks of different sizes arranged in descending order of size, with the largest on the bottom and the smallest on top of the stack. The goal of this game is to move all the disks from Tower A to Tower C, being able to use Tower B as an auxiliary, following the only essential rule: no larger disk can be placed on top of a smaller one.

### Visualization:
At [Tower of Hanoi](https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/towerofhanoi.html) link, you can play or view the Tower of Hanoi solution.

### Specification:
- This project can be done in pairs.
- The delivery will be in person on 05/02.
- The solution must use a recursive procedure.
- The number of disks must be entered by the user and can have up to two digits, that is, your program must be able to read this number.
- The program must be made in Assembly X86 using the Nasm or Tasm compiler for Windows.

### Program Output Example:
- Tower of Hanoi Algorithm with 3 disks
- Move disk 1 from Tower A to Tower C
- Move disk 2 from Tower A to Tower B
- Move disk 1 from Tower C to Tower B
- Move disk 3 from Tower A to Tower C
- Move disk 1 from Tower B to Tower A
- Move disk 2 from Tower B to Tower C
- Move disk 1 from Tower A to Tower C
- Completed!
